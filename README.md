# CRGV_16S_1HNMR
The scripts and data in this repository detail the statistical analysis and characterisation of the faecal microbiota and metabolome of dogs using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance.

NB. As stated in the manuscript, MatLab R2018b (v 9.5) was used; and all of the NMR data has been split into batch 1 - 3 for the sole reason of uploading to Github. These will need to be combined in a single folder to directly carry out the same analysis.
